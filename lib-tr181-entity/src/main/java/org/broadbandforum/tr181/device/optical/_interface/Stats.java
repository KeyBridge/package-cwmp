	 * Throughput statistics for this interface.

        The CPE MUST reset the interface's Stats parameters (unless otherwise stated in individual object or parameter descriptions) either when the interface becomes operationally down due to a previous administrative down (i.e. the interface's {{param|#.Status}} parameter transitions to a down state after the interface is disabled) or when the interface becomes administratively up (i.e. the interface's {{param|#.Enable}} parameter transitions from {{false}} to {{true}}). Administrative and operational interface status is discussed in {{bibref|TR-181i2|section 4.2.2}}.
