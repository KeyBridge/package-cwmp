# CWMP managed objects library in Java

**A CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) managed objects library in Java**

This project contains Java classes compiled from various specification documents
that together make up the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP).

CPE WAN Management Protocol allows an Auto-Configuration Server (ACS) to provision
a customer premise equipment (CPE) or collection of CPE based on a variety of criteria.

TR-069 describes the CPE WAN Management Protocol, intended for communication
between a CPE and Auto-Configuration Server (ACS). The CPE WAN Management
Protocol defines a mechanism that encompasses secure auto-configuration of a CPE, and
also incorporates other CPE management functions into a common framework.

# Pull requests and Making changes

This entire software library is automatically generated from a document compiler
developed and managed by Key Bridge. This means that if you have found a bug in
one file that same bug is probably repeated throughout the library.

If you find an error in **ANY** file please tell us immediately. You can either do this
by making a pull request with the suggested fix or by creating an issue ticket.
